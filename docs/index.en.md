# Preface

## Why ToolDiy

We have learned the difference between humans and other animals from middle school textbooks: humans make and use tools for productive labor, while animals do not. Many tools have been born in the process of human beings engaged in productive labor. But what is frustrating is that along with the update of the tool comes the high cost of learning, mainly because of **not understanding the features of the tool, obscure English documents and time-consuming trial costs** . That's how we came up with the idea of creating **ToolDiy**. We create a community dedicated to collecting and refining god-level tools from all walks of life (the most suitable for you are god-level tools), so as to reduce the cost of using tools. For example:

- TeXmacs is a WYSIWYG open source editor for scientific documents (papers, notes, etc.).
- MarkText is an open source Markdown editor.
- Translation is a translation plug-in for JetBrain IDE, which greatly facilitates the development of developers with poor English foundation

These tools are not limited to any discipline or aspect, nor are they limited to any one programming language**. After understanding these, let's start our ToolDiy.
