Aiming at enhancing the browser reading experience, simpread provides a focus mode that dilutes irrelevant elements to increase concentration and a completely pure reading mode. And you can export web pages to various formats such as markdown to the local, or import them into notion, onenote and other note-taking applications after authorization, which is convenient for archiving and reading it later. There are also many related plugins in the official plug-in center, but the default mode experience is also quite comfortable.

Save papers directly to Zotero from the web page, and support the selection of saving categories.
