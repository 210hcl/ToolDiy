# 为什么要有本书

我们从中学课本就被告知人类和其他动物的区别：人类会制造使用工具从事生产劳动，动物则不会。是的为了帮助我们从事生产劳动诞生了许许多多的工具，但是令人沮丧的是，随着现在不断发展变革的工具，我们很难轻易入门一款工具，大多数情况是我们基于自己的功能需求打开搜索引擎之后在一堆链接中不断尝试，有的会是生涩的英文文档，有的会是寥寥几句说明，我们的使用成本陡增。现在我们想以开源社区的环境致力于收集和提炼各行各业的神级工具(最适合你的都是神级工具)。我们希望能够减低工具的使用成本尽量以新手的入门上手视角推荐好用的工具，这些工具不局限于任和特殊的学科只要能够给一些人带来更好的体验或者启发一些人开发更好的工具(使用评价就是最好的用户诉求)，提高生产效率那么这个项目就算成功了。好的那么现在我们开始我们tooldiy吧。

We have been taught the difference between humans and other animals from middle school textbooks: humans can make and use tools for productive labor, while animals do not. Yes, many tools have been born to help us engage in productive labor, but it is frustrating that with the continuous development and change of tools, it is difficult for us to easily get started with a tool. In most cases, we are based on our own functions After opening the search engine, we need to keep trying a bunch of links, some of which will be jerky English documents, and some will be a few sentences of instructions, and our usage costs will increase sharply. Now we want to collect and refine god-level tools from all walks of life in an open source community environment (the most suitable ones are god-level tools). We hope to reduce the cost of using tools and try our best to recommend useful tools from the perspective of beginners. These tools are not limited to any and special subjects as long as they can bring some people a better experience or inspire some people to develop better ones. Tools (use evaluation is the best user appeal), improve production efficiency, then the project will be considered a success. Ok so now let's start our tooldiy.
