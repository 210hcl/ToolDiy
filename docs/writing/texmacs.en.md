Try GNU TeXmacs if you are being tortured by $\LaTeX$! GNU TeXmacs is a WYSIWYG open source editor for scientific documents (papers, notes, etc.). Highly recommended if you write lots of maths!

Features:

- Editing tables and formulas visually.
- Intuitive keyboard shortcuts. One of them is that when editing a mathematical formula, you can switch to similar symbols by pressing `tab` multiple times. For example, press `a` and then press `tab` to get $\alpha$ and other characters that looks like a.
- Support many computer algebra systems and interactive software, similar to Jupyter Notebook
- Support Scheme and macros for hacking

In most cases the built-in documentations will suit your needs. Occasionally, there are outdated parts in the documentation. In this case you can read [The Jolly Writer](https://www.scypress.com/book_info.html), which is also written by the main author of TeXmacs.

Remember to switch to Chinese mode (click the national flag on the menu bar), otherwise it will not line wrap automatically.
